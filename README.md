# Motion-Planning-for-Mobile-Robot

Motion planning for wheeled mobile robot in a given map provided there are no dynamic
obstacles this is done for one of the wheel drives discussed above namely Differential
Drive. Mentioning the kinematics both forward kinematics and inverse kinematics
equations to accomplish the task the use of Probabilistic Road Map(PRM) followed by
A*algorithm completes the path planning the rest is motion controlling that is made
possible with the help of one of the matlab function controlPurePursuit which is then
combined its results with inverse and forward kinematics of the differential drive. And
the vizualization is along made to make the things more like simulation
